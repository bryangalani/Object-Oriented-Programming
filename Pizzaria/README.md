# Static

* **Static Variable**: The variable is global (general) of the class and not specific for each object. The variable must be accessed using the name of the class and not the instance of each object (does not need an instance, to access the static variable). The value of a static variable is the same for all instances of the class.

* **Static Method**: It is a method of the class that does not depend of any instantiated variable (from objects). This method just use static variable, so it can be called without having any instantied object of the class.

* **HashMap**: Like a dictionary (key, value).
